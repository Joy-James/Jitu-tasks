1.What is the difference between state and props?

-State is the local state of the component which cannot be accessed and modified outside of the component.
 -It's equivalent to local variables in a function. 


-Props, on the other hand, make components reusable by giving components the ability
 to receive data from their parent component in the form of props.
-Props are used to customize the behavior of the child component, but they cannot change over time.


2.With the following code blocks, can you say what will happen in each of these instances?

    const c1 = 1; c1 = 3;


    const c2 = “hello”; c2 += “world!”;

    const c3 = {}; c3.name = “Geoff”; c3.someValue = “Sausage”; c3 = {};


      //In the first code block, you are trying to reassign a value to a constant declared 
      //with const, which is not allowed in JavaScript.
      //You will receive an error message:

      // In the second code block, you are updating a string value, which is allowed in JavaScript. 
      //The string "hello" is assigned to c2, and then the expression c2 += "world!" will concatenate the string "world!" to c2, so the final value of c2 will be "helloworld!".

      // In the third code block, you are updating an object property, which is allowed in JavaScript. 
      //The object {} is assigned to c3, and then you add properties name and someValue to the object.
       // However, you are then trying to reassign c3 to a new object {}, which is not allowed in JavaScript because c3 was declared with const. 
       //You will receive an error message:
     

3.Outline the various stages of the React.js lifecycle.
  A) Initial Render or Mount-Mounting means putting elements into the DOM.
     React has four built-in methods that gets called, in this order, when mounting a component:

        -constructor()
       - getDerivedStateFromProps()
       - render()
       - componentDidMount()

  B) Update -when the state used in a component is changed.
     A component is updated whenever there is a change in the component's state or props.

      React has severalbuilt-in methods that gets called, in this order, when a component is updated:

          -getDerivedStateFromProps()
          -shouldComponentUpdate()
          -render()
          -componentDidUpdate()

  C)Unmount-The next phase in the lifecycle is when a component is removed from the DOM.
      It is the final phase of the react component lifecycle.
      It is called when a component instance is destroyed and unmounted from the DOM.
      This phase contains only one method ;

        -componentWillUnmount()

4.How are controlled and uncontrolled components different?
     In a controlled component, form data is handled by a React component.
     Whereas in uncontrolled components, form data is handled by the DOM itself.
     To write an uncontrolled component, instead of writing an event handler for every state update, you can use a ref to get form values from the DOM

5.Explain what three dots mean in React.
      These three dots are called the spread syntax or spread operator. 
      The spread syntax is a feature of ES6, and it's also used in React.
      Spread syntax allows you to deconstruct an array or object into separate variables
       Example; let arr=(45,56,60)
                console.log(... arr);
